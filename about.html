                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Joy and spice are captured in every cup of coffee poured at The Coffee Trade. Located in Avon, CT, our shop serves up freshly roasted coffee for coffee drinkers and commuters in Farmington, West Hartford, Granby, Simsbury, Canton, and the surrounding Connecticut areas. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In operation since 1985, The Coffee Trade was originally opened by a coffee plantation owner from Guatemala. Sold to local residents in 1995, The Coffee Trade continues to serve the good people of Avon delicious and bold cups of coffee thirty years later. The shop was built less than 50 years after the American Revolution, providing a charming and cozy atmosphere in which to enjoy one of our 80 varieties of coffee beans.
